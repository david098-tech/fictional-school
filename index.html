      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Fictional School was established in 1932 during the late colonial period,
        originally as a small mission school serving just 12 students beneath the
        shade of a large baobab tree. Early lessons were conducted in both the
        local language and English, with a focus on literacy, arithmetic, and
        practical skills such as farming.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the decades passed, the school grew into a cornerstone of the
        community. In the 1950s, when many African nations were beginning to push
        for independence, Fictional School became more than just a place of
        learning‚Äîit was a gathering place for debate, cultural expression, and
        hope for self-determination. Several of the region‚Äôs early political and
        community leaders were once pupils here.
      </p>
      <p>
        After independence in the 1960s, the government officially recognized
        Fictional School as a model for rural education. New classrooms were built
        using locally made bricks, and the old baobab tree‚Äîwhere the very first
        lessons were taught‚Äîwas preserved as a symbol of knowledge and resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the 1980s and 1990s, despite challenges such as economic hardship
        and limited resources, Fictional School remained open thanks to strong
        community support. Parents, alumni, and even students helped maintain the
        grounds, repair buildings, and raise funds for books. This spirit of
        collective responsibility became known as ‚ÄúThe Fictional Way.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Fictional School has grown into a respected educational institution
        with over 1,200 students, offering programs in science, arts, technology,
        and sports. The school emphasizes both modern innovation and traditional
        wisdom, teaching students about local history, culture, and the
        environment.
